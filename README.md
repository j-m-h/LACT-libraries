Libraries for Los Altos Community Botball Teams.



Notes:

To use these libraries, put #include "createDrive.h" for create drivebases or #include "drive.h" for link drivebases at the top of your main file (you will need to copy/paste the code you need into files saved under the same name in your project).  You can then use any of the functions from the drive library you included and the generic library in your main file.

You don't need to include generic.h, as it is included in each drive library.

Lines marked with /* */ at the beginning signify values that may be different on your robot, and so require testing.

For more information on what all the bytes mean for the create libraries, see http://www.irobot.com/filelibrary/pdfs/hrd/create/Create%20Open%20Interface_v2.pdf

If you have any questions or need help getting something to work, you can send me an email at james.m.hulett@sbcglobal.net
